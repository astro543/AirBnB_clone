## AirBnB Clone Project 

### Background Context

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to guide you through building an AirBnB clone web application step by step. Before you begin, make sure to read the AirBnB concept page for an overview of the project.

### Project Overview

The initial step of the project involves creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This command interpreter will lay the foundation for the subsequent stages of the web application development. This first step is crucial as the components you build here will be used in tasks such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API implementation, and front-end integration.

Throughout this project, you will:

- Define a parent class named `BaseModel` responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing future object instances.
- Establish a simple flow of serialization and deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File.
- Create various classes (User, State, City, Place, etc.) for AirBnB objects, all inheriting from `BaseModel`.
- Develop the initial storage engine of the project, known as File storage.
- Formulate comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of your classes and storage engine.

### Command Interpreter

Think of the command interpreter as a limited version of the Shell, tailored to manage the objects within the AirBnB project. It enables you to perform the following tasks:

- Create new objects, such as Users or Places.
- Retrieve objects from files or databases.
- Perform operations on objects, like counting or computing statistics.
- Update attributes of objects.
- Delete objects.

### Resources

To successfully complete this project, familiarize yourself with the following resources:

- `cmd` module
- `uuid` module
- `datetime` module
- `unittest` module
- Concepts of packages and modules
- Understanding of `args` and `kwargs` in Python functions
- JSON file reading and writing
- Python testing practices using `unittest`

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be capable of explaining the following concepts without external assistance:

- Creation of a Python package
- Development of a command interpreter using the `cmd` module
- Understanding and implementation of unit testing in a larger project
- Serialization and deserialization of a class
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Handling of datetime data
- Usage and significance of UUIDs
- Application of `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python functions
- Management of named arguments in functions

### Copyright and Plagiarism

This project emphasizes originality and understanding of the tasks at hand. To meet the learning objectives, you must develop solutions independently. Copying or plagiarism will result in removal from the program. Content from this project must not be published.

### Requirements

#### Python Scripts

- Use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- Code is interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of each file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A mandatory `README.md` file at the project's root.
- Code should adhere to `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
- All files must be executable.
- Documentation for modules, classes, and functions is mandatory.

#### Python Unit Tests

- Tests should be located in the `tests` folder.
- Utilize the `unittest` module for testing.
- Test files should start with `test_` and be organized as per your project's structure.
- Execute tests using `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.

**Note:** Collaborative work on test cases is recommended to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Remember, this project is designed to enhance your understanding and skills, so embrace the learning process and enjoy building your AirBnB clone!
